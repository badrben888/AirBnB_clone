# AirBnB Clone

Greetings and welcome to the AirBnB Clone Console! You've just embarked on the initial phase of creating the AirBnB clone project, a comprehensive web application designed to emulate certain features of the renowned accommodation rental platform, Airbnb.

## Description

The AirBnB Clone Console is a Python-powered command-line interface (CLI) designed for the management of AirBnB entities, such as users, states, cities, places, and more. This console empowers you to execute a wide range of operations on these entities, encompassing their creation, retrieval, modification, and deletion.

As part of the integration of the command-line interpreter with the backend and file storage system, you have the capacity to execute the following actions:

Crafting new objects (e.g., generating a new User or a new Place).
Fetching an object from a file, database, and other sources.
Executing operations on objects (such as counting and computing statistics).
Modifying attributes of an object.
Eradicating an object when necessary.
